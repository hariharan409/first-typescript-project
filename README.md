# first-typescript-project
This is my first TypeScript project, where I explore TypeScript fundamentals and its integration with modern JavaScript projects.  Features: Basic TypeScript setup with tsconfig.json. Demonstrates type annotations, interfaces, and classes. Explores modules, generics, and utility types. Build process with TypeScript compiler (tsc).
